Objects in JavaScript are a fundamental data type that allow us to store and manipulate data in a structured way.
They are key-value pairs, where the keys are strings or symbols and the values can be any type of data. 
Objects are often used to represent real-world entities, such as a person, a car, or a bank account.

JavaScript objects are dynamic, meaning that properties can be added or removed at any time.
They are also reference types, which means that when an object is assigned to a variable,
the variable holds a reference to the object in memory, rather than a copy of the object.

JavaScript objects are internally represented as a hash table, also known as an associative array. 
A hash table is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to values. When an object property is accessed, 
the JavaScript engine uses the key to calculate a hash value, which is then used to find the corresponding value in the hash table.

The internal representation of objects in JavaScript can also be represented as a tree-like structure,
where the object is the root and its properties are the branches. The properties of an object can also be objects,
creating a nested structure

This allows for a hierarchical organization of data, making it easy to access and manipulate nested properties.
One important thing to note is that, the order of properties in an object is not guaranteed to be the same as the order in which they were added.
